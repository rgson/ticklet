# Ticklet

`ticklet` is a command-line tool for ticket management (the bug tracker kind).
It keeps track of tickets, including status, affected files and related notes.

## Usage

Usage instructions can be viewed at any time by running `ticklet -h`.
The program also comes with an associated manual page (`man ticklet`).

```
usage: ticklet [-h] [--version] [-l] [-k] [-a] [-u] [-o] [-d] [-s STATUS]
               [-m SUMMARY] [-p PROFILE]
               [TICKET [TICKET ...]]

positional arguments:
  TICKET                ticket(s) to act upon

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -l, --list            list active tickets
  -k, --list-all        list all tickets
  -a, --archive         move tickets to archive
  -u, --unarchive       move tickets from archive
  -o, --open            open existing tickets only
  -d, --delete          delete tickets
  -s STATUS, --status STATUS
                        set the status
  -m SUMMARY, --summary SUMMARY
                        set the summary
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        use an alternative configurations profile
```

## Installation

### Debian-based distributions

The recommended approach for users of Debian-based systems is to install the
program in the form of a `.deb` package.

Pre-built `.deb` packages can be downloaded from the
[releases page](https://github.com/rgson/ticklet/releases).
Alternatively, one can be built from source: 

```sh
# 1. Build the .deb package
sudo apt install devscripts fakeroot equivs git-buildpackage
mk-build-deps -i -s sudo debian/control
make deb

# 2. Install ticklet and its dependencies
sudo apt install ../ticklet_*.deb
```

### Other distributions

The program can also be installed in a more distribution-agnostic way using
`make install`. The Makefile supports the use of [DESTDIR](gnu-destdir) and
other relevant [directory variables](gnu-dirvars) to customize the installation.

Generally, the installation goes something like this:

1. Install Python 3 and the other [dependencies](requirements.txt).
2. Build and install `ticklet` using `make install`.

```sh
# 1. Run a staged install in a local sub-directory
make install DESTDIR=./stage

# 2. Verify that the directory structure in ./stage suits your system

# 3. Perform a system-wide install
sudo make install
```

## Configuration

Some of `ticklet`'s behavior can be configured through
`~/.config/ticklet/config.yaml`.

The list of active plugins is of particular interest to every `ticklet` user.
It determines the actions taken when a ticket is opened. Due to users' wildly
divergent preferences for different text editors, etc., there is
**no default action** when opening tickets. Defining your own setup with the
help of plugins is thus essential for a major part of `ticklet`'s functionality.

```yaml
# Example config
---
directory:
  active: /home/yourname/tickets/active
  archive: /home/yourname/tickets/archive

display:
  grid: false

template: |
  # Ticket {id}
  
  _Summary_:
  _Status_ : New
  
  
  ## Files
  
  -
  
  
  ## Notes
  
  

plugins:
  files:
    filter:
      - git
    open:
      - nemo
      - gnome-terminal
      - vscode

profiles:
  read: # the profile's name
    plugins:
      files:
        filter:
          - notes_only
        open:
          - vscode
```

## Plugins

Plugins define the actions taken when a ticket is opened. They define both the
selection of files/directories that are opened and how they are opened.

Conceptually, plugins are divided into two categories: *filters* and *openers*.

- Filters are used to process the list of files from the ticket notes, before it
  is passed to the openers.
- Openers define how the files and directories are actually opened.

Plugins are created in the form of very simple Python modules, consisting of a
single Python source file defining one or both of the functions
`filter_files(files, dirs)` and `open_files(files, dirs)`.
The source file must be installed in the plugin directory (default:
`/usr/local/lib/ticklet/plugins`, or `/usr/lib/ticklet/plugins` on Debian).

The [user configuration](#configuration) determines which plugins that are
loaded and used.

A few example plugins are included in the [plugins](plugins) directory, e.g. the
[git filter](plugins/git.py) and the [Nemo opener](plugins/nemo.py).

## Profiles

Profiles allow configurations to be temporarily overridden using the
`-p`/`--profile` option. Settings specified in a profile will temporarily
override the corresponding settings as defined in the user's default
configuration, while retaining the rest without change.
